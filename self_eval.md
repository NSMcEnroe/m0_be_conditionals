# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code? When there are many processes and branching paths that can occur.  For example, when creating a password, there might be many reasons why the password can not be accepted (length, characters, numbers, etc.).  You would to explain to the user what they are missing in their password.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?  After completing the challenges, I looked over what my group mates had submitted.  Tyler mentioned modulo.  If I had to do this assignment over, I would probably research modulo to see if that would make the coding process more efficient.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
I felt today I made strides in my googling ability.  Whenever I got stuck, I was able to quickly continue on the right path after finding the right link relatively quickly.
